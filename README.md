# Nonlinear Orbital Dynamics
simulating complex Newtonian dynamics with the Runge-Kutta algorithm

# Henon-Heiles
main programs in orbital dynamics investigates the runge-kutta algorithm to simulate nonlinear Newtonian dynamics of a particle with the Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian

# Examples
you can find some simpler systems such as the SHO or a 1D projectile simulated with the Runge-Kutta algorithm
