simulating complex Newtonian dynamics with the Runge-Kutta algorithm

# Runge-Kutta
folder: runge_kutta_integrator
these are a series of supporting matlab functions which implements the RK algorithm for the Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian.
the Hamiltonian has to be modified since the RK algorithm differentiates the Hamiltonian in order to perform the updates
(need symbolic differentiator like Mathematica)

# Henon-Heiles
folder: orbital_dynamics_Henon_Heiles
main programs in orbital dynamics investigates the runge-kutta algorithm to simulate nonlinear Newtonian dynamics of a particle with the Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian. You should be able to execute any of these files when you download the repo


# Examples
you can find some simpler systems such as the SHO or a 1D projectile simulated with the Runge-Kutta algorithm
